IDK I'm too tired to think. Careless errors like comparing index instead of value at index. need to review how square rooting works

1. []() (private)
```
function reverse(arrayOfChars) {
  // ['y', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
  //             .
  //             *
  // Reverse the input array of characters in place
  let start = 0; // 0 1 
  let end = arrayOfChars.length - 1; //4 3
  
  while (start < end) {
    let temp = arrayOfChars[start]; // d c
    arrayOfChars[start] = arrayOfChars[end]; // a  
    arrayOfChars[end] = temp; // c
    start++;
    end--
  }
  console.log(arrayOfChars)
  return arrayOfChars
}
```


### Day 5: Sep 1, Tuesday (1)

**Today's Progress**: Finished frequency counting hw problems

**Thoughts** 
##### Success: 
getting familiar with finding approach
algorithms weren't difficult

##### Trouble/Questions:
- in need of review/practice of:
1. iterating over maps
2. new Map() vs let map = {} and how to iterate over each
3. next time if implementation is well-practice, i'll just run through algo and move on for time sake - can implement later but want to focus on algo and ds I'm struggling with

struggled with Sort Digits -> need to review math tricks
struggled with not using builtin sort, not sure if this is an issue or not
##### Trouble/Questions:
I'm not used to syntax/doing coding challenges in javascript

### Day 2: Aug 29, Saturday (1)

##### Trouble/Questions:
Unsure of BigO
